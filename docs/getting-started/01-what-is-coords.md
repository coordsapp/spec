# 01 - What Coords Is

## Goal
Coords is an open spatial identity platform.

It gives teams two layers:
- L1: immutable coordinate URIs (machine-safe, checksummed)
- L2: human handles (easy to use, resolvable to L1)

## Why it exists
- Prevent location typos and ambiguity
- Make spatial references stable over time
- Keep protocol open (CC0) while hosted services stay optional

## What is open vs hosted
- Open protocol: `coordsapp/spec`
- Reference CLI: `coordsapp/core`
- Hosted resolver and enterprise workflows: `coordsapp/cloud`
