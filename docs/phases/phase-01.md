# Phase 1 - Open Protocol Foundation

## Status
Completed

## Objective
Publish an open, vendor-neutral Coords foundation across spec, core, and cloud scaffolding.

## Delivered
- Protocol v1 docs and test vectors in `coordsapp/spec/v1/`
- Offline Go CLI in `coordsapp/core` with:
  - `coords encode <lat> <lng> <alt>`
  - `coords decode <uri>`
- Initial cloud resolver scaffold in `coordsapp/cloud`

## Outcome
Coords became usable as an open protocol with a reference CLI and service baseline.
