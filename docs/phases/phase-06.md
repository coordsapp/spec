# Phase 6 - Landing Experience and Developer Onboarding

## Status
In Progress (started February 16, 2026)

## Objective
Turn `coords.up.railway.app` into a clear product entry point that communicates value quickly and drives developers into successful integration workflows.

## Goal
Move visitors from discovery to first useful API usage in under 10 minutes.

## Scope
- Landing page redesign at `/`
- Developer onboarding dashboard at `/app`
- Documentation hub routes under `/docs/*`
- In-browser resolver demo and starter code samples
- Enterprise pathway messaging and conversion links

## Initial Route Set
- `GET /`
- `GET /app`
- `GET /docs`
- `GET /docs/quickstart`
- `GET /docs/api-reference`
- `GET /docs/use-cases/logistics`
- `GET /docs/protocol`

## Execution Plan
1. Week 1: launch landing, docs hub, and quickstart-driven onboarding
2. Week 2: expand interactive onboarding, richer docs, and conversion instrumentation

## Success Metrics
- Landing-to-signup/docs click-through >= 25%
- Onboarding flow completion >= 60%
- Time to first successful resolver call < 10 minutes
- Measurable increase in enterprise inquiry volume
